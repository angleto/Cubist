# Cubist

This project is a fork of [Cubist](https://www.rulequest.com/cubist-info.html).

Cubist builds rule-based predictive models that output values, complementing [See5/C5.0](https://github.com/angleto/C5.0) that predicts categories. For instance, [See5/C5.0](https://github.com/angleto/C5.0) might classify the percentage yield from some process as "high", "medium", or "low", whereas Cubist would output a number such as "7.3".
